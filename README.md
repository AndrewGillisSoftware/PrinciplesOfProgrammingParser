# PrinciplesOfProgrammingParser

### Project Details

Project Explanation:
The team implemented a Simple Python Parser utilizing the Java language and ANTLR library. Through ANTLR, the team created a working grammar that parses through a sample python program and recognizes if/else blocks, loops, variable definitions, arithmetic and assignment operations, conditional statements, and comments. The program then provides a visualization of the parse tree created from the parser.

Team Members: Ben Hudson, Paul Gillis, Aidan Henry, Andrew Gillis 

**Git Commit History Disclaimer:**
Everyone did equal work although it may not show that in the git commit history. We worked together using discord and would share screens to work on the similar sections of the at the same time. The commit history is just whoever ended up pushing the code at any given point. Look at our peer evaluations for our true contributions to the team.
